#### *IG Xinkebot Usage:*

The Xinkebot has been modified to use a Bondtech extruder and an E3D Volcano hotend to be very reliable and durable. There is also another extruder available that is designed to be used with flexible filament such as NinjaFlex (very floppy) or TPU (medium rubber). Send a message to the group if you want to print flexibles. Currently, the Xinkebot is equipped with a 8mm nozzle for fast printing.

*Getting Ready:*

If the previous person did not clean the bed when (s)he was done, you will have to use a single edge razor blade to scrape it off, and then clean thoroughly with Windex before proceeding.

Next, view [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh5xY5OpKHQ) up to the 3 minute mark. Instead of using a ruler, use the yellow plastic speed square with the base on the clean glass bed, making sure the extruder bar is exactly the same height on both sides (left and right). You can do this by raising/lowering the extruder as is done on the video, and get one side so that the speed square just barely slides under, then adjust the other side manually, as in the video, to just slide under exactly the same as the other side.

The printer should already have been leveled and autoleveled before you are using it (directions below), but the z-endstop height can drift, so check it as it is done in the video.
1. Turn on the printer with the switch at the back left of the bottom frame.
2. Choose "Tool" on the screen.
3. Choose "Manual" on the screen. This is the manual movement control.
4. Check to make sure the nozzle does not touch the bed when moving the Z-axis all the way to zero. Do this slowly choosing the distance on the bottom of the screen. It's OK to use 10mm increments if the nozzle is far from the bed, but go down to 1mm or even 0.1mm as you get closer. If the nozzle is at the appropriate height, then you are ready to print. If not, you will need to adjust the Z-endstop, which is manually adjusted on the Xinkebot as shown in the video linked above.
5. I recommend turning the screw just a little further (maybe 1/8 turn) clockwise as viewed from below to make the nozzle just ever so slightly closer to the glass.

*Prepare the bed:*

For the size of your print, smear a thin coat of Magigoo in the center of the bed. You will find the bottle of Magigoo in the clear bin under the table below the printer.
1. Shake the bottle of Magigoo "like you mean it".
2. Use the applicator to smear a thin layer of Magigoo on the glass where your print will be.

*Load Your Filament:*
1. Be sure your filament is dry. If needed, dry your filament overnight in the filament dryer at IG.
2. Snip the end of your filament at an angle with scissors.
3. Feed your filament through the white tube until it gets all the way to the extruder.
4. Rotate the thumbwheel on the extruder (it's a white plastic gear) until the filament will no longer advance.
5. Using the LCD Panel on the printer, heat the extruder to 220 degrees.
6. Rotate the thubmwheel on the extruder until your filament color is clearly seen.

*Print:*

1. Choose "Print" on the home screen. If you are not on the home screen, you can click the "back" arrow in the lower part of the screen.
2. The bed will heat up automatically.
3. The nozzle will heat up automatically then the print will start.
4. Watch the entire first layer to make sure everything is going OK. If not, you need to start over. Click the pause button, then the cancel button.
You MUST stay for the duration of at least the first layer, longer if possible. A successful first layer is a good predictor of a successful print.

*Auto-leveling:*

Do NOT attempt this procedure if you have not been taught how to do it, you could easily damage the printer. The auto-leveling procedure should not need to be done very often so you probably won't need to do this. If you find that your prints are not getting a good even first layer, then you will have to follow this procedure.
1. First, watch the video linked above after the 3 minute mark.
2. You will have to remove the Bondtech extruder assembly, and install the red Flexion extruder assembly.
3. Follow the instructions on the video from here on out. Do NOT forget to remove the sensor when the printer is finished!
4. Put the Bondtech extruder back on and set the Z-endstop for the correct offset as outlined in the first 3 minutes of the above video.
